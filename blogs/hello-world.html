    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Readers,<br/><br/>
        I am starting this blog to share my ideas & learnings to the world. Over time, I have realised that most of my time, not just mine but all of humanity is going into consuming things and not creating something new. It all started with the rise of radio, televisions, online social networking and now social content websites. Most of it is just consumption of information; we didn't share our ideas on radio, they gave their version of ideas. Same happened with televisions, during initial years social networking sites, we had this idea of sharing our ideas with the world but with rapid developments; instead of becoming a place to share our ideas, it became a place for businesses and content creators. And we the people, just became consumers like all previous communication mediums.<br/><br/>
        I had always wanted to create something of my own and explore the world. Like all children, when I was young, I wanted to become an astronaut and go to space and far beyond. The idea was exciting, being able to go to unexplored worlds where no one had ever been before. Then as I grew up, priorities changed. Looking at the admission rates of astronauts, it became a distant dream. But a new dream born, to become a scientist. It was the closest thing to astronaut but not that much competitive. We could research on things we find interesting. There were so many things to study. Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology. So many chemicals mixing which generated lots of interesting things. So many physical laws and mathematical equations, which explained natural things so beautifully. The beauty of biology, having so many living beings each one so different and unique, which almost seems impossible. As I grew up I was introduced to computers in my school. It was such a wonderful thing, to be able to interact with machine and make it follow our instructions. Intantly made me fall in love with this new technology. The main thing was I was not consuming but creating. Creating the designs in logo using programming syntaxes. It was mind blowing. My curiosity kept on growing and I began to learn all kind of things we can create on computers. At a very young age, I started developing websites, learning to hack and protect them, learning to make full operating systems. all these even before I went to college. Those were the kind of things we as humans were meant to do; create things, make humans progress in science and technology.<br/><br/>
        The sad reality is now most of us are not doing any such things. A majority of people are trapped in the cycle of consumerism most of which are western inventions, which is fine to an extent to maintain a healthy economy. But just consuming won't do anything for us. We need to think and make technology work for us and not vice-versa.<br/><br/>
        My main aim to start this blog is to overcome from consuming content and to think and deliver the what's on my mind so that even one person reading this can gain a new perspective and be motivated in doing so.
